# BetterReplay

BetterReplay is a server-side replay plugin for Paper and Folia-style scheduling.
It records player and nearby entity activity on the server, saves the timeline, and replays it for viewers in-game.

## What this project is

- Server plugin written in Java
- Targets modern Paper APIs
- Uses PacketEvents and FoliaLib for packet handling and scheduling
- Supports two storage backends:
  - local file storage
  - MySQL
- New saves use finalized binary `.br` replay archives; legacy JSON replays are still readable during the migration window, but older alpha `.br` inventory archives are intentionally not loaded by current builds

## How this differs from client-side replay mods

BetterReplay is not a client recording mod.

Server-side approach (this project):
- Runs entirely on the server
- No replay mod required on player clients
- Captures server-observed gameplay state and events
- Plays back by spawning and updating replay entities for a viewer
- Good for moderation, event review, and server-side tooling

Typical client-side replay mod approach:
- Records from a specific client perspective
- Usually requires modded client setup
- Often includes advanced free-camera/cinematic editing features
- Playback is usually local to the client recording

In short: BetterReplay focuses on server-managed replay workflows and API-driven integration.

## Notable capabilities

### Binary storage and admin tooling

New saves are written as finalized binary `.br` archives for both file and MySQL storage. Active recordings stream into crash-safe append logs first, which lets BetterReplay recover orphaned temporary recordings on the next startup instead of silently losing them after a crash or forced stop.

Current `.br` archives use binary replay format `v2`, which records equipment state and storage inventory as separate raw-byte payloads. Legacy JSON replay loading remains available during migration, but pre-`v2` alpha binary inventory archives are intentionally unsupported.

The same archive format powers the hidden admin utilities:

- `/replay export` writes filtered `.br` exports under the plugin `exports/` folder
- `/replay debug info` inspects replay metadata such as format, version, counts, sizes, and recording timestamp
- `/replay debug dump` writes a human-readable event dump under `dumps/`
- `/replay benchmark` generates Markdown and JSON benchmark reports under `benchmarks/`

### Replay protection and cleanup

Protected replays are excluded from both manual deletion and retention cleanup until they are explicitly unprotected. `/replay list` can highlight protected entries, and the `Retention.*` settings accept human-readable durations like `30d` and `1h` so scheduled cleanup stays readable for operators.

### Chunk-aware playback

When `Recording.Chunk-Capture.Enabled` is turned on, BetterReplay stores palette-compressed chunk baselines for the captured area around tracked players inside the `.br` archive. During playback, those chunk snapshots are streamed around the viewer as an overlay and then restored back to live world state when the replay window moves or the replay ends.

`Playback.Chunk-Mode` controls how aggressively live chunks are restored. Mode `1` keeps a moving replay chunk window and restores live chunks as they leave it. Mode `2` defers live chunk restore until replay stop, lets Paper and the client unload chunks naturally, and resends replay chunks if the viewer returns after a natural unload. `Playback.Chunk-Send-Limit-Per-Tick` and `Playback.Chunk-Clear-Limit-Per-Tick` both default to `1`, which is safer on mixed live servers; dedicated replay servers can raise them with `Playback.Chunk-View-Radius` to fill and clear larger replay windows faster. Replay-load probing now runs ahead of chunk sends at `10x` the configured send rate so missing-chunk checks do not become the bottleneck when most nearby chunks were never recorded. `Playback.Chunk-Timing-Diagnostics` adds per-stage timing logs for chunk preparation, replay load, and live restore work when you need to profile MSPT spikes.

### Playback controls

Paused replays can step backward or forward one tick group at a time, and active replays support configurable slower/faster controls through `Playback.Speed-Step` and `Playback.Max-Speed`. The current speed multiplier is shown in the action bar so viewers can tell immediately whether they are watching at `1.0x` speed or a faster/slower rate.

- Replay names may contain spaces as long as all filter arguments come after the full replay name.

Hidden debug info usage:
- `/replay debug info <name>` prints replay metadata including format, recording timestamp, record count, tick length, compressed/decompressed sizes, and version/index details.
- Replay names may contain spaces.

Hidden benchmark usage:
- `/replay benchmark run <small|medium|large|all>` starts an asynchronous synthetic benchmark run and writes both Markdown and JSON reports under the plugin `benchmarks/` folder.
- `/replay benchmark last` prints the most recent report file paths.

## Configuration

Default config keys and migrations are defined in:
- [src/main/java/me/justindevb/replay/config/ReplayConfigSetting.java](src/main/java/me/justindevb/replay/config/ReplayConfigSetting.java)
- [src/main/java/me/justindevb/replay/config/ReplayConfigManager.java](src/main/java/me/justindevb/replay/config/ReplayConfigManager.java)

### Storage-Type options

Valid values for `General.Storage-Type` are:

- `file`
  - Stores replay data under the plugin data folder.
  - New saves now write finalized binary `.br` archives.
  - The loader still auto-detects legacy JSON payloads and current finalized binary `.br` archives through `ReplayStorageCodec` during the transition period.
- `mysql`
  - Stores replay data in a MySQL table (`replays`) using the configured `General.MySQL.*` values.
  - New saves now store finalized binary `.br` archives as blob data.
  - The loader still auto-detects legacy JSON payloads and current finalized binary `.br` archives during the transition period.

These values should be lowercase as shown above.

### File storage example

```yaml
General:
  Check-Update: true
  Storage-Type: file
```

### MySQL storage example

```yaml
General:
  Check-Update: true
  Storage-Type: mysql
  MySQL:
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 3306
    database: betterreplay
    user: replay_user
    password: change-me
```

Additional key used by command pagination:

```yaml
List:
  Page-Size: 10
  Protected-Highlight-Color: "&6"
```

Playback diagnostics key:

```yaml
Playback:
  Speed-Step: 0.2
  Max-Speed: 1.0
  Chunk-Mode: 1
  Chunk-View-Radius: 3
  Chunk-Send-Limit-Per-Tick: 1
  Chunk-Clear-Limit-Per-Tick: 1
  Chunk-Timing-Diagnostics: false
```

Chunk baseline capture keys:

```yaml
Recording:
  Chunk-Capture:
    Enabled: false
    Radius: 1
    Capture-Interval-Ticks: 20
    Max-Unique-Chunks-Per-Recording: 20000
```

Retention cleanup keys:

```yaml
Retention:
  Enabled: false
  Max-Age: 30d
  Check-Interval: 1h
  Delete-Partial-Failures: false
  Log-Deletions: true
```

Notes:
- If Storage-Type is invalid, plugin falls back to file storage.
- MySQL replay names are stored in a VARCHAR(64) primary key column.
- Binary `.br` payloads require the replay data column to be `LONGBLOB`; the plugin now widens `data` automatically during storage initialization.
- Chunk baseline capture is stored only in finalized binary `.br` archives; legacy JSON replays remain timeline-only.
- `Recording.Chunk-Capture.Enabled` captures palette-compressed chunk baselines around tracked players during recording and replays those block states on demand around the viewer.
- `Recording.Chunk-Capture.Radius` controls the square chunk-interest window around each tracked player.
- `Recording.Chunk-Capture.Capture-Interval-Ticks` controls how often the plugin recomputes chunk interest and exports newly discovered chunks.
- `Recording.Chunk-Capture.Max-Unique-Chunks-Per-Recording` bounds capture size; once the cap is reached, recording continues but additional chunk baselines are skipped.
- `Playback.Chunk-View-Radius` controls the replay viewer's chunk playback radius independently from recording capture radius. Default is `3`.
- `Playback.Chunk-Mode` controls replay chunk teardown semantics. `1` keeps the current moving replay window and restores live chunks as they leave that window. `2` defers live chunk restore until replay stop, lets Paper and the client unload chunks naturally, and resends replay chunks if the viewer returns after a natural unload. Default is `1`.
- `Playback.Chunk-Send-Limit-Per-Tick` and `Playback.Chunk-Clear-Limit-Per-Tick` control how aggressively packet-friendly chunk playback fills and clears the replay viewer's chunk window. Both default to `1`; dedicated replay servers can raise them to support larger view radii with less concern about live server impact. Replay-load probing runs at `10x` the configured send limit so uncaptured chunks can be ruled out quickly without waiting on the actual packet send rate.
- If `Playback.Chunk-View-Radius` is larger than `Recording.Chunk-Capture.Radius`, only chunks that were actually captured during recording can be replayed; uncaptured chunks stay on the live world view.
- `Playback.Chunk-Timing-Diagnostics` logs per-stage replay chunk timing information at runtime so you can inspect async preparation, replay load application, and queued live restore costs while profiling MSPT spikes.
- Protected replays are skipped by both retention cleanup and manual delete commands until they are explicitly unprotected.
- Protection stores required audit metadata: `protectedAt` and `protectedBy`.
- Protected replays are highlighted in `/replay list` using `List.Protected-Highlight-Color`; the default is gold (`&6`).
- Retention durations accept `s`, `m`, `h`, and `d` suffixes.
- Legacy JSON replay support is temporary compatibility only and is planned for removal in a later version; new recordings should stay on `.br`.
- Older alpha `.br` archives using the pre-`v2` inventory encoding are intentionally unsupported; retain legacy JSON if you need a migration path across that binary format boundary.
- The hidden `/replay benchmark` command is now always available to senders with `replay.benchmark`, and `General.Enable-Benchmark-Command` has been removed from config

## API

BetterReplay provides a public API for other plugins to start/stop recordings, manage replays, and listen for lifecycle events.

Quick example:

```java
ReplayManager manager = ReplayAPI.get();
manager.startRecording("demo-session", List.of(player), 120);
manager.stopRecording("demo-session", true);
manager.startReplay("demo-session", viewerPlayer);
```

For full documentation of every method, all events, and a complete example plugin, see the **[API Documentation](docs/API.md)**.

## Documentation

- [docs/BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md) - benchmark command usage, workload presets, and metric definitions
- [docs/BINARY_FORMAT_SPEC.md](docs/BINARY_FORMAT_SPEC.md) - binary replay payload and archive structure notes, including the current `v2` inventory/event split
- [docs/ARCHIVE_MANIFEST_SCHEMA.md](docs/ARCHIVE_MANIFEST_SCHEMA.md) - `manifest.json` field definitions and validation rules
- [docs/DEPRECATIONS.md](docs/DEPRECATIONS.md) - planned feature and compatibility removals

Binary replay note:
- Finalized `.br` archives now store the recording start wall-clock timestamp in `manifest.json` as `recordingStartedAtEpochMillis`.
- Active temp append-logs also write a fixed file header carrying the same timestamp so final saves can preserve it after crash-safe recovery.
- Current `.br` archives use format version `2` and store equipment-state and storage-inventory payloads as separate raw item-byte records.
- Chunk-enabled `.br` archives may also include `chunks/` region entries containing palette-compressed chunk baselines that are decoded lazily during playback.
