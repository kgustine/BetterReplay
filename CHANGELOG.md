and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `/replay reload` command to re-read `config.yml`, restart retention scheduling, and report which changed settings apply immediately, only to new sessions, or still require a server restart
- Frame-by-frame step controls during paused replay; step backward or forward one tick at a time via `⏮`/`⏭` inventory buttons (slots 6–7)
- Variable playback speed controls during active replay; adjust with `⏪ Slower`/`⏩ Faster` inventory buttons (slots 6–7) using configurable step increments
- Current playback speed displayed in the action bar as `[X.Xx]` during playback
- New config keys `Playback.Speed-Step` (default `0.2`) and `Playback.Max-Speed` (default `1.0`) to control speed increment and upper bound
- Replay viewer safety controls: `Playback.Viewer-Safety-Mode`, `Playback.Restore-Viewer-Location-On-Stop`, `Playback.Restore-Viewer-GameMode-On-Stop`, `Playback.Restore-Viewer-Flight-On-Stop`, and `Playback.Restore-Viewer-State-On-Rejoin`
- Finalized binary `.br` replay storage for file and MySQL backends, including crash-safe append-log recording, lazy indexed loading, preserved recording start timestamps, startup recovery of orphaned temp logs, filtered export tooling, hidden benchmark/debug utilities, and temporary legacy JSON compatibility during migration
- Replay protection commands and metadata, protected replay highlighting in `/replay list`, and config-driven retention cleanup with duration parsing
- Optional chunk baseline capture and chunk-aware playback for binary replays, including block-entity support, replay chunk caching, `Playback.Chunk-View-Radius`, `Playback.Chunk-Send-Limit-Per-Tick`, `Playback.Chunk-Clear-Limit-Per-Tick`, `Playback.Chunk-Timing-Diagnostics`, and `Playback.Chunk-Mode`
- Split inventory recording into dedicated equipment-state and storage-snapshot events backed by raw item bytes, plus regression coverage for the new binary payloads and legacy JSON upgrade path
- New config key `Playback.Vanish-Viewer` (default `true`) to hide replay viewers from live players during playback

### Fixed
- `activeSessions` in `RecorderManager` changed to `ConcurrentHashMap` to prevent `ConcurrentModificationException` (#33)
- PacketEvents block-break recording is now rescheduled onto the server thread to avoid Netty-thread contention and unsafe shared-state mutation (#43)
- Held-item swaps and hotbar slot changes are now captured immediately for more accurate replay inventory playback
- Replay viewers can no longer pick up live world items during playback, preventing replay inventory lockups from stray pickups
- Equipment polling now reuses a single per-tick capture across concurrent recordings and only falls back to clean-player sweeps periodically, reducing repeated ItemStack serialization under high recording load
- Dirty inventory polls now reuse a shared short-lived storage snapshot cache across concurrent recordings, while clean fallback sweeps still force a fresh capture to preserve missed-change detection
- Nested replay inventory loss when starting a replay during an active replay (#31)
- Replay playback now returns viewers to their original location and gameplay state by default, including disconnect/rejoin recovery
- Replay controls getting stuck after replay ends (#27)
- Replay export now writes under the plugin data folder
- Chunk playback restore flow now handles unload timing and viewer return cases more reliably
- Replay chunk load probing now frees completed missing-chunk checks before scheduling the next async wave, so higher chunk send limits are not throttled by one-tick queue lag when many surrounding chunks were never recorded
- Replay chunk load probing now runs at `10x` the configured chunk send rate, so fast `missing-replay-chunk` checks do not throttle how quickly the viewer can discover whether nearby chunks were actually recorded
- Config migration now preserves wrapped pseudo-comments, keeps the managed header stable, and avoids accumulating blank lines between root sections

### Changed
- `RecordingStopEvent` now fires synchronously to fix async AntiCheatReplay compatibility
- `ReplayManager` now exposes `listSavedReplaySummaries`, `protectSavedReplay`, `unprotectSavedReplay`, and returns `ReplayDeleteResult` from `deleteSavedReplay`
- Config settings ownership moved out of `Replay` into a dedicated typed, comment-preserving config manager with versioned migrations
- Replay sessions now always start at `1.0x` speed; `Playback.Max-Speed` is enforced to a minimum of `1.0`
- Config keys for list settings were renamed from `list-page-size`/`list-protected-highlight-color` to `List.Page-Size`/`List.Protected-Highlight-Color`; values are auto-migrated on startup
- Update checks now treat `-SNAPSHOT` builds as their corresponding release, and Modrinth publishing metadata now includes Purpur, Spigot, and Bukkit loaders
- Modrinth uploads now publish the matching release changelog on `main` and the `[Unreleased]` section for `dev` alpha builds
- Binary replay archives now use format version `2`; new `.br` inventory payloads store split equipment/storage slot bytes directly, while legacy JSON replay loading remains supported and older alpha `.br` inventory archives are intentionally unsupported

- `-SNAPSHOT` suffix stripped before update version comparison (#18)
- Playback controls activating when clicking recorded entities (#16)
