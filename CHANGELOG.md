## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Modrinth auto-publish via CI with alpha-aware update checking
- `HeldItemChange` event for instant hand swap and slot change recording
- Comprehensive test suite (251 tests across 5 phases)
- Sealed `TimelineEvent` records replacing raw `Map<String, Object>` for type-safe timeline events
- Source organization plan executed (Tier 1 + Tier 2 package restructure)
- Enum-based config settings model with centralized, typed config keys (pending merge in #36)
- Versioned config migration with one-time comment backfill for legacy config files (pending merge in #36)
- Phase 1 binary replay format contracts for `.br` archives, manifest defaults, event tags, varint framing, and tick-index layout
- Phase 2 storage abstractions: `ReplayStorageCodec`, `ReplayFormatDetector`, append/finalizer/archive reader interfaces, and JSON codec seam coverage
- Phase 3 append-log recording path with CRC32C-framed temp files, incremental string definitions, and streaming recording-session persistence
- Phase 4 binary replay finalization with append-log recovery scanning, LZ4-compressed `replay.bin` archives, manifest CRC32C checksums, and rebuilt 50-tick seek indexes
- Phase 5 binary replay loading with `.br` archive detection, manifest version gates, heap decompression, lazy indexed event decode, and seek support from finalized checkpoints
- Phase 6 backend integration with `.br` saves for file and MySQL storage, MySQL `LONGBLOB` migration, and mixed JSON/binary backend compatibility coverage
- Phase 7 filtered replay export with `ReplayExportQuery`, player and tick-range filters, `player=all` defaults, and binary archive exports built from lazy indexed scans
- Phase 8 legacy-compatibility prep keeps JSON replay loading during the transition, prefers `.br` when mixed file payloads coexist, and documents JSON support as temporary compatibility slated for later removal

### Fixed
- `activeSessions` in `RecorderManager` changed to `ConcurrentHashMap` to prevent `ConcurrentModificationException` (#33)
- Nested replay inventory loss when starting a replay during an active replay (#31)
- Replay controls getting stuck after replay ends (#27)
- Static `Replay.getInstance()` NPEs in test environments (#32)
- Deprecation warnings and unused imports cleaned up
- Config migration comment placement and header ordering for generated configs (pending merge in #36)
- Wrapped YAML pseudo-comment values now load correctly during idempotent config initialization (prevents parse failure on long comment lines)
- Config rewrite now deduplicates managed header text and keeps `Config-Version` at the top for cleaner layout
- Config migration no longer accumulates extra blank lines between `Config-Version` and subsequent root sections

### Changed
- All commands routed through `ReplayManager` API (#25)
- `RecordingStopEvent` now fires synchronously to fix async AntiCheatReplay compatibility
- All `printStackTrace()` calls replaced with proper logger calls
- CI actions bumped to v4 for Node.js 24 compatibility
- Config settings ownership moved out of `Replay` into a dedicated comment-preserving config manager (pending merge in #36)
- Replay sessions now always start at `1.0x` speed; `Playback.Max-Speed` is enforced to a minimum of `1.0`
- Generated config output now inserts blank lines between root-level keys/sections for readability

- `-SNAPSHOT` suffix stripped before update version comparison (#18)
- Playback controls activating when clicking recorded entities (#16)
- Replay time display using array index instead of recorded tick (#15)
- Inventory tracking via tick-based diff; sync during FF/RW seek (#14)
