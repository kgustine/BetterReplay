# BetterReplay Binary Replay Format Specification

This document describes the BetterReplay binary replay format.

The current runtime format is `v2`. The archive framing, append-log structure, payload header, and chunk sections described below are still aligned with the original `v1` contract unless explicitly called out otherwise. The `v2` format change replaces the old monolithic inventory payload with split `EquipmentStateUpdate` and `InventoryStorageUpdate` records that store raw item bytes directly. Older alpha `.br` archives that used the pre-`v2` inventory encoding are intentionally unsupported by current loaders.

It is intended to be readable by developers who need to understand how replay data is structured on disk, how the archive is organized, and how the binary payload should be decoded.

For the archive manifest fields specifically, see [ARCHIVE_MANIFEST_SCHEMA.md](ARCHIVE_MANIFEST_SCHEMA.md).

## Scope

This specification covers:

- the `.br` archive layout
- the append-log temp file header used during recording and crash recovery
- the compressed replay payload stored in `replay.bin`
- event record framing
- string-table usage
- tick index structure
- failure behavior for unsupported or malformed content

This specification does not try to define every implementation class or API surface in the plugin.

## Design Goals

The binary format is designed around these goals:

- reduce CPU cost compared with JSON + GZIP
- reduce recording-time memory pressure
- support crash recovery during active recording
- support fast seek by tick during playback
- keep the final replay artifact identical across file and MySQL backends
- keep the v1 format strict and easy to reason about

## High-Level Model

BetterReplay stores a finalized replay as a `.br` archive.

The archive contains:

- `manifest.json`
- `replay.bin`
- optional `chunks/` region entries when chunk snapshot capture is enabled

The `manifest.json` entry provides replay metadata and compatibility information.

The `replay.bin` entry contains the finalized replay payload:

- compressed as a single payload frame, using Zstd level 1 for new archives
- decompressed fully into a heap `byte[]` when loaded for playback
- decoded lazily from that in-memory byte array as playback advances

Legacy archives may store `replay.bin` as a single LZ4 frame and remain readable.

During active recording, BetterReplay first writes an append-only temp file under `replays/.tmp/`.
That append-log has its own fixed file header so metadata needed during crash recovery is persisted before any framed records are appended.

## Archive Layout

The `.br` file is a ZIP-style archive whose entries are stored using `STORE` rather than a second archive-level compression pass.

### Required v1 entries

| Entry name | Required | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `manifest.json` | Yes | Replay metadata, versioning, checksum, and compatibility gate |
| `replay.bin` | Yes | Compressed finalized replay payload |

### Timeline payload compression

New archives declare `payloadCompression` in `manifest.json` and write `replay.bin` with Zstd level 1.

Supported timeline payload codecs:

| Manifest value | Frame magic | Meaning |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| `lz4_frame` | `04 22 4D 18` | Legacy LZ4 frame-compressed replay payload |
| `zstd` | `28 B5 2F FD` | Zstd-compressed replay payload; new archive default |

Readers must use `payloadCompression` when it is present. If the field is absent, readers may fall back to frame magic detection for compatibility with existing archives.

### Optional chunk-enabled entries

| Entry name pattern | Required | Purpose |
|-------------------|----------|---------|
| `chunks/<world>/r.<regionX>.<regionZ>.brregion` | No | Region-grouped chunk snapshot payloads |

### Reserved prefixes

| Prefix | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `chunks/` | Chunk region entries and related chunk artifacts |
| `meta/` | Future auxiliary metadata entries |

These prefixes are reserved in v1. `chunks/` is now defined for chunk-enabled archives but is still optional.

### Reader safety limits

BetterReplay applies fixed allocation limits while reading persisted replay data. These limits are reader safety policy rather than additional encoded fields, so they do not change the archive format or the Zstd/LZ4 compatibility contract.

| Resource | Maximum |
|----------|---------|
| Stored replay file or MySQL value | 128 MiB |
| ZIP entries | 65,536 |
| ZIP entry name | 1 KiB UTF-8 |
| `manifest.json` | 1 MiB |
| Compressed `replay.bin` | 128 MiB |
| Decoded timeline payload | 256 MiB |
| One `.brregion` entry | 64 MiB |
| Total retained ZIP entry data | 128 MiB |
| Decoded chunk payload | 8 MiB |
| One append-log event record | 128 MiB |
| One temporary chunk-region append log | 128 MiB |
| String value | 1 MiB UTF-8 |
| Serialized item or block-entity NBT value | 2 MiB |
| Chunk index rows per region | 1,024 |
| Timeline events | 2,000,000 |
| Timeline string-table entries | 1,000,000 |
| Timeline tick-index entries | 2,000,000 |

Readers reject non-STORED entries, unknown or non-canonical entry names, duplicate names, mismatched declared sizes, unsupported codec metadata, and codec/frame-magic mismatches. LZ4 and Zstd output is read through a bounded stream; chunk output must exactly match its positive declared uncompressed length. Encoded collection counts are also constrained by remaining input bytes and format geometry before allocation.

## Chunk Archive Entry Naming

Chunk region entries use this canonical naming pattern:

- `chunks/<worldSegment>/r.<regionX>.<regionZ>.brregion`

Rules:

- `regionX` and `regionZ` use plain signed base-10 decimal text
- `.brregion` is the fixed finalized region-entry extension
- `worldSegment` is derived from the world name by UTF-8 encoding it and percent-encoding every byte outside `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`
- percent-encoding uses uppercase hex byte escapes such as `%20` and `%2F`

Examples:

- `chunks/world/r.0.0.brregion`
- `chunks/world%20name%2Fnether/r.-2.7.brregion`

## Chunk Payload Codec Rules

The finalized chunk region format and the temp region append-log both use a one-byte codec identifier.

Supported finalized chunk payload codecs:

| Codec ID | Name | Meaning |
|----------|------|---------|
| `0x01` | `LZ4_FRAME` | Payload bytes are one standalone LZ4 frame for a single chunk snapshot payload |
| `0x02` | `ZSTD` | Payload bytes are one standalone Zstd frame for a single chunk snapshot payload; new archive default |

Unknown chunk codec identifiers are a hard parse failure for the affected entry.

## Chunk Payload Formats

Chunk-enabled archives use one uncompressed chunk payload family for every chunk payload stored under `chunks/`.

Frozen payload families:

| Payload magic | Version | Status | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|--------|---------|
| `BRCS` | `1` | legacy/current implementation | block-state baseline payload |
| `BRCP` | `1` | frozen next contract | packet-friendly chunk snapshot payload |

Rules:

- one archive must not mix multiple chunk payload families or versions
- packet-friendly archives must declare `chunkPayloadFormat = "BRCP"` and `chunkPayloadVersion = 1` in `manifest.json`
- legacy chunk-enabled archives may omit those manifest fields and are interpreted as `BRCS` version `1`

## Legacy Chunk Baseline Payload (`BRCS`)

The uncompressed bytes inside each chunk payload encode one full chunk baseline snapshot before the per-chunk compression frame is applied.

v1 uses this layout:

| Field | Width | Encoding | v1 value |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| magic | 4 bytes | raw ASCII bytes | `BRCS` |
| version | 1 byte | unsigned byte | `0x01` |
| reserved | 3 bytes | zero-filled | `0x00 0x00 0x00` |
| `minY` | 4 bytes | little-endian signed int32 | world minimum build height |
| `height` | 4 bytes | little-endian signed int32, positive in valid payloads | vertical block span for this snapshot |
| `paletteSize` | VarInt | non-negative | number of unique block-state strings |
| `palette[]` | repeated | length-prefixed UTF-8 strings | deterministic insertion order of block-state strings |
| `stateIndexes[]` | `16 * 16 * height * 2` bytes | little-endian unsigned uint16 values | palette index for each block in Y-major, then Z-major, then X-major order |

Rules:

- `stateIndexes` always covers exactly one chunk volume of `16 * 16 * height` blocks
- palette indices reference entries in `palette[]`
- v1 chunk capture stores block states only; block entities, lighting, and biome data are intentionally excluded
- playback decodes this payload lazily when a viewer enters the corresponding recorded chunk window

This payload is documented here because it is still the current implementation. It is not the target long-term packet-friendly snapshot contract.

## Packet-Friendly Chunk Snapshot Payload (`BRCP`)

`BRCP` is the frozen next chunk payload contract for chunk-packet playback.

Design intent:

- keep the payload internal-model based rather than storing exact outbound packet bytes
- keep it section-oriented so packet builders can emit chunk packets without per-block rebuilding
- preserve enough data for correct initial chunk rendering without making the archive format depend on transient live packet byte layouts

### `BRCP` header

| Field | Width | Encoding | v1 value |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| magic | 4 bytes | raw ASCII bytes | `BRCP` |
| version | 1 byte | unsigned byte | `0x01` |
| flags | 1 byte | unsigned bitfield | see below |
| reserved | 2 bytes | zero-filled | `0x00 0x00` |
| `minSectionY` | 4 bytes | little-endian signed int32 | minimum section Y for the chunk snapshot |
| `sectionCount` | 4 bytes | little-endian signed int32, positive in valid payloads | number of vertical sections stored in this chunk |
| `blockEntityCount` | unsigned varint | non-negative | number of trailing block entity records |

Total fixed-width header size before `blockEntityCount`: `16` bytes.

### `BRCP` flags

| Bit | Name | Meaning in v1 |
|-----|------|---------------|
| `0x01` | `HAS_BIOMES` | must be set |
| `0x02` | `HAS_BLOCK_ENTITIES` | set if and only if `blockEntityCount > 0` |
| `0x04` | `STORES_HEIGHTMAPS` | must be clear |
| `0x08` | `STORES_LIGHT` | must be clear |
| `0x10-0x80` | reserved | must be clear |

### `BRCP` section payloads

After the header, exactly `sectionCount` section payloads are written in ascending section-Y order starting at `minSectionY`.

Each section payload uses this layout:

| Field | Encoding | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `blockPaletteSize` | unsigned varint | number of block-state palette entries |
| `blockPalette[]` | repeated varint length + UTF-8 bytes | canonical block-state strings |
| `blockBitsPerEntry` | unsigned byte | `0` only when `blockPaletteSize == 1` |
| `blockWordCount` | unsigned varint | number of packed 64-bit words for the 4096 block indices |
| `blockWords[]` | repeated 8-byte little-endian int64 | packed block-state palette indices |
| `biomePaletteSize` | unsigned varint | number of biome palette entries |
| `biomePalette[]` | repeated varint length + UTF-8 bytes | biome namespaced keys |
| `biomeBitsPerEntry` | unsigned byte | `0` only when `biomePaletteSize == 1` |
| `biomeWordCount` | unsigned varint | number of packed 64-bit words for the 64 biome-cell indices |
| `biomeWords[]` | repeated 8-byte little-endian int64 | packed biome palette indices |

### `BRCP` block entity payloads

After all section payloads, exactly `blockEntityCount` block entity records are written.

Each block entity record uses this layout:

| Field | Encoding | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `packedXZ` | unsigned byte | upper nibble = local X (`0-15`), lower nibble = local Z (`0-15`) |
| `yOffset` | unsigned varint | block Y offset relative to `minSectionY * 16` |
| `typeKey` | varint length + UTF-8 bytes | namespaced block-entity type key |
| `nbtLength` | unsigned varint | byte length of `nbtBytes` |
| `nbtBytes` | raw bytes | binary NBT compound payload used for client block-entity initialization |

### `BRCP` rules

- `sectionCount` covers the full vertical chunk span needed for replay playback on the recorded world height; omitted vertical gaps are invalid
- section block-state indices always represent `16 * 16 * 16 = 4096` cells in Y-major, then Z-major, then X-major order
- section biome indices always represent `4 * 4 * 4 = 64` biome cells in Y-major, then Z-major, then X-major order
- packed palette indices are written as a dense fixed-width bit stream where value `n` starts at bit offset `index * bitsPerEntry` within the concatenated 64-bit word stream
- `blockPalette[]` entries use canonical Bukkit/Paper block-data strings suitable for deterministic runtime re-resolution
- `biomePalette[]` entries use namespaced biome keys
- `nbtBytes` stores binary NBT, not SNBT text and not full raw packet bytes
- heightmaps are not stored in `BRCP`; packet builders derive the required heightmap payload from section block states at send time
- light data is not stored in `BRCP`; replay playback reuses the viewer's live-world lighting state and accepts lighting drift as a known limitation of this phase

## Finalized Chunk Region Entries (`.brregion`)

Each `.brregion` entry stores chunk snapshots for one Minecraft region in a playback-optimized format.

The file layout is:

1. fixed region header
2. fixed-width region-local chunk index
3. concatenated compressed payload area

Chunk payloads are stored independently, so a reader can seek to and decompress one chunk without decoding the rest of the region entry.

The region container design is expected to survive the payload refactor even if the per-chunk uncompressed payload contract changes.

For `BRCP` version `1`, the finalized region container layout is intentionally unchanged from the legacy `BRCS` container layout. Only the compressed payload contents and the manifest metadata differ.

### Region header

| Field | Width | Encoding | v1 value |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| magic | 4 bytes | raw ASCII bytes | `BRRG` |
| version | 1 byte | unsigned byte | `0x01` |
| flags | 1 byte | unsigned byte | `0x00` |
| reserved | 2 bytes | zero-filled | `0x00 0x00` |
| `indexEntryCount` | 4 bytes | little-endian signed int32, non-negative in valid files | number of index rows |
| `payloadSectionOffset` | 4 bytes | little-endian signed int32, non-negative in valid files | byte offset of the first payload byte |

Total v1 region header size: `16` bytes.

`payloadSectionOffset` must equal `16 + indexEntryCount * 16` in v1.

### Region index rows

Each v1 region index row is fixed-width at `16` bytes.

Rows are written in deterministic lexicographic order by `(localChunkX, localChunkZ)`.

| Field | Width | Encoding | Notes |
|-------|-------|----------|-------|
| `localChunkX` | 1 byte | unsigned byte | `0-31` within the region |
| `localChunkZ` | 1 byte | unsigned byte | `0-31` within the region |
| `codecId` | 1 byte | unsigned byte | `0x01` (`LZ4_FRAME`) or `0x02` (`ZSTD`) |
| reserved | 1 byte | zero-filled | must be `0x00` in v1 |
| `payloadOffset` | 4 bytes | little-endian signed int32, non-negative in valid files | offset relative to the start of the payload area, not the file start |
| `compressedLength` | 4 bytes | little-endian signed int32, positive in valid files | compressed payload byte count |
| `uncompressedLength` | 4 bytes | little-endian signed int32, positive in valid files | uncompressed chunk byte count |

Duplicate `(localChunkX, localChunkZ)` rows are invalid.

Payload ranges must not overlap.

### Payload area

The payload area begins at `payloadSectionOffset` and contains only raw compressed chunk payload bytes concatenated in index order.

The v1 region format does not add a per-chunk footer or trailer after the index row metadata.

## Temp Region Append-Log

Recording-time chunk capture uses append-friendly temp region files rather than writing finalized `.brregion` entries directly.

The temp file layout is:

1. fixed temp-region header
2. repeated fixed-header append records

### Temp-region header

| Field | Width | Encoding | v1 value |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| magic | 4 bytes | raw ASCII bytes | `BRTC` |
| version | 1 byte | unsigned byte | `0x01` |
| flags | 1 byte | unsigned byte | `0x00` |
| reserved | 2 bytes | zero-filled | `0x00 0x00` |

Total v1 temp-region header size: `8` bytes.

### Temp append record

Each appended chunk snapshot record uses this layout:

| Field | Width | Encoding | Notes |
|-------|-------|----------|-------|
| `localChunkX` | 1 byte | unsigned byte | `0-31` within the region |
| `localChunkZ` | 1 byte | unsigned byte | `0-31` within the region |
| `codecId` | 1 byte | unsigned byte | `0x01` (`LZ4_FRAME`) or `0x02` (`ZSTD`) |
| flags | 1 byte | unsigned byte | must be `0x00` in v1 |
| `uncompressedLength` | 4 bytes | little-endian signed int32, positive in valid files | original payload length |
| `compressedLength` | 4 bytes | little-endian signed int32, positive in valid files | stored payload byte count |
| `payloadChecksum` | 4 bytes | little-endian unsigned CRC32C stored in an int32 slot | checksum of the compressed payload bytes only |
| `payload` | `compressedLength` bytes | raw bytes | independently compressed chunk payload |

Total v1 temp record header size before the payload: `16` bytes.

The temp append-log intentionally relies on `compressedLength` rather than a separate `recordLength` field.

For `BRCP` version `1`, the temp-region container layout is also unchanged. Recording-time writers still append one compressed chunk payload per record; only the uncompressed payload bytes change from `BRCS` to `BRCP`.

## Chunk Corruption Policy

Chunk snapshots remain optional additive data on top of the required `manifest.json` + `replay.bin` contract.

Default v1 policy:

- missing or corrupt `.brregion` entries disable chunk sidecar usage and degrade to timeline-only playback for the affected recorded area
- corrupt per-chunk payload metadata inside a region entry degrades the affected replay chunk state only
- strict hard-fail behavior is reserved for future opt-in configuration, not the default contract

## Append-Log Temp File

The recording path writes an append-only temp file before finalizing a `.br` archive.

This append-log exists to support:

- low-overhead sequential writes while recording
- crash-safe recovery of the longest valid record prefix
- persistence of replay-level metadata needed before final archive creation

### Append-log v1 file layout

1. fixed append-log header
2. framed record stream

### Fixed append-log header

The header is written once when the temp file is created and flushed immediately.

| Field | Width | Encoding | v1 value |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| magic | 4 bytes | raw ASCII bytes | `BRAL` |
| header version | 1 byte | unsigned byte | `0x01` |
| flags | 1 byte | unsigned byte | `0x00` |
| reserved | 2 bytes | zero-filled | `0x00 0x00` |
| `recordingStartedAtEpochMillis` | 8 bytes | little-endian signed int64 | Unix epoch milliseconds |

Total append-log header size: `16` bytes.

### Append-log header rules

- the header must be present before any framed record bytes
- the recording start timestamp must be preserved when finalizing a recovered append-log after a crash
- malformed or truncated headers are a hard recovery failure
- future append-log metadata should be added by extending this header rather than embedding replay-level metadata in normal event records

## Replay Payload Model

After decompression, `replay.bin` is treated as a single binary payload with three logical parts:

1. payload header
2. event stream
3. tick index section

The payload ends with an 8-byte little-endian footer that points to the start of the tick index section.

This model matches the chosen goals:

- sequential writes are possible during recording via a temp append-log
- random access is available in finalized replays via the tick index
- the finalized format is still compact and easy to validate

## Payload Header

The payload begins with a small fixed header used to identify the payload and support basic validation.

### Header fields

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| magic bytes | Identifies the payload as a BetterReplay binary replay payload |
| payload format version | Matches the archive `formatVersion` conceptually for parser compatibility |
| reserved flags | Reserved for future format-level behavior |
| reserved bytes | Must be zero in v1 |

### Exact v1 header layout

| Field | Width | Encoding | v1 value |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| magic | 4 bytes | raw ASCII bytes | `BRPL` (`0x42 0x52 0x50 0x4C`) |
| payload format version | 1 byte | unsigned byte | `0x01` |
| flags | 1 byte | unsigned byte | `0x00` |
| reserved | 2 bytes | zero-filled | `0x00 0x00` |

Total v1 payload header size: `8` bytes.

### v1 header rules

- the header must be present before the first event record
- the payload format version for v1 is `1`
- the primitive byte order for multi-byte numeric fields is little-endian
- unknown or incompatible payload header values must fail replay load immediately

This format remains strict in v1. If the payload header is invalid, the replay is treated as malformed or unsupported.

## Event Stream

The event stream is the ordered sequence of decoded replay events.

Each event type is identified by a numeric tag rather than a string discriminator.

The event stream may also contain `DEFINE_STRING` records, which populate the string table used by later events.

### Record tag table

The record tag namespace is frozen for v1.

| Tag | Record |
|-----|--------|
| `0x00` | `DEFINE_STRING` |
| `0x01` | `PlayerMove` |
| `0x02` | `EntityMove` |
| `0x03` | `InventoryUpdate` |
| `0x04` | `HeldItemChange` |
| `0x05` | `BlockBreak` |
| `0x06` | `BlockBreakComplete` |
| `0x07` | `BlockBreakStage` |
| `0x08` | `BlockPlace` |
| `0x09` | `ItemDrop` |
| `0x0A` | `Attack` |
| `0x0B` | `Swing` |
| `0x0C` | `Damaged` |
| `0x0D` | `SprintToggle` |
| `0x0E` | `SneakToggle` |
| `0x0F` | `EntitySpawn` |
| `0x10` | `EntityDeath` |
| `0x11` | `PlayerQuit` |

### Event stream rules

- records are processed in order
- string definitions must appear before any event that references them
- the finalized payload keeps normal record framing
- the finalized payload does not keep per-record CRC
- payload integrity is validated at the archive/manifest level instead

## Record Framing

Each finalized replay payload record uses explicit length framing.

### Finalized replay payload record

| Field | Encoding | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `recordLength` | unsigned LEB128 / protobuf-style varint | Length of the record contents after the length field |
| `recordType` | unsigned LEB128 / protobuf-style varint | Event tag or special tag such as `DEFINE_STRING` |
| `payload` | raw bytes | Record-specific payload |

### Framing rules

- `recordLength` includes everything in the record except `recordLength` itself
- every record must be skippable based on `recordLength`
- unknown event tags are a hard failure in v1, even if the replay passed the version gate
- all v1 varints are non-negative and are limited to 5 bytes for `int`-sized values

## String Table

The format uses a string table to avoid repeating UUIDs, names, world names, entity types, and other repeated string values in every event.

### How it works

- when a string is first encountered, the writer emits a `DEFINE_STRING` record
- the string is assigned a numeric index
- later events store the numeric index instead of the full string

### Benefits

- smaller raw payload size
- less repeated string processing during recording and playback
- cleaner event payload structure

### String table rules

- string indices are encoded as varints
- string values are encoded as UTF-8 with a non-negative varint byte-length prefix followed by raw UTF-8 bytes
- a string index is valid only if it has already been defined in the stream or loaded from the finalized index section
- the first defined string uses index `0`

### `DEFINE_STRING` payload layout

| Field | Encoding | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `stringIndex` | unsigned varint | Must match the next sequential string-table slot |
| `stringValue` | varint length + UTF-8 bytes | Length is the encoded byte length, not character count |

## Integer Encoding

The format uses varint encoding for compact integer storage where fixed-width integers are wasteful.

### Used for

- `recordLength`
- string table indices
- record tags
- other compact integer fields where fixed width is not required

### Exact v1 varint format

- unsigned, non-negative integer encoding only
- 7 payload bits per byte
- high bit set means another byte follows
- little-endian bit packing across bytes (standard unsigned LEB128 / Protocol Buffers varint)
- maximum width is 5 bytes for 32-bit values used in v1 framing and string references

### Not typically used for

- coordinates stored as raw numeric primitives
- offsets in the tick index

## Primitive Field Encoding

The binary payload stores primitive event fields directly in binary form rather than in decimal string form.

Typical examples:

- coordinates as raw doubles
- yaw and pitch as raw floats
- tick values in index entries as explicit 32-bit integers
- offsets as 64-bit integers

This avoids the text formatting and parsing cost that made the JSON path expensive.

### Exact primitive rules

| Primitive | Encoding |
|-----------|----------|
| `boolean` | single byte: `0x00` false, `0x01` true |
| `int32` | 4-byte little-endian two's-complement |
| `int64` | 8-byte little-endian two's-complement |
| `float32` | 4-byte IEEE 754 little-endian |
| `float64` | 8-byte IEEE 754 little-endian |

## Tick Index

The finalized replay payload includes a tick index section used to seek quickly into the replay.

### v1 checkpoint policy

- fixed checkpoint interval of 50 ticks
- each entry stores both:
	- the checkpoint tick
	- the byte offset of the first event record at or before that checkpoint tick
- offsets are stored as 64-bit values
- each index entry is fixed-width at 12 bytes total

### Exact entry layout

| Field | Width | Encoding |
|-------|-------|----------|
| checkpoint tick | 4 bytes | little-endian signed integer, non-negative in valid files |
| byte offset | 8 bytes | little-endian signed integer, non-negative in valid files |

Both values are required in every v1 index entry. Ticks must align to the fixed 50-tick checkpoint interval.

### Exact v1 index section layout

The index section begins at the footer offset and uses this layout:

| Field | Encoding | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `indexMagic` | 4 raw bytes | ASCII `BRIX` |
| `stringCount` | unsigned varint | Number of finalized string-table entries |
| `strings` | repeated varint length + UTF-8 bytes | Entire finalized string table in index order |
| `tickIndexCount` | unsigned varint | Number of tick-index entries |
| `tickIndexEntries` | repeated fixed-width entries | Each entry is 12 bytes |

After the index section, the payload ends with:

| Field | Width | Encoding |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `indexSectionOffset` | 8 bytes | little-endian signed integer, non-negative in valid files |

The footer points to the first byte of `indexMagic`.

### Why explicit tick + offset entries

- more robust than deriving ticks only from entry position
- easier to validate and debug
- easier to evolve later if index rules change

### Example entries

- tick `0` -> offset of first record for tick 0
- tick `50` -> offset of first record for tick 50
- tick `100` -> offset of first record for tick 100

### Playback seek behavior

To seek to tick `T`:

1. find the nearest checkpoint at or before `T`
2. preload the finalized string table from the index section
3. jump to that stored byte offset
4. decode forward until tick `T` is reached

## Finalized Payload Integrity

The finalized replay payload does not use per-record CRC fields.

Instead, v1 relies on a whole-payload checksum stored in `manifest.json`.

### Integrity rules

- checksum validation applies to the finalized replay payload as a whole
- corruption or checksum mismatch must fail replay load immediately
- checksum algorithm naming is defined in the manifest schema

## Recording-Time Append-Log vs Finalized Payload

The active-recording temp file and the finalized payload are related but not identical.

### Temp append-log

Used while recording is in progress and retained across plugin shutdown so startup recovery can finalize interrupted recordings.

Each temp record contains:

- `recordLength`
- `recordType`
- `payload`
- `crc32c`

Purpose:

- crash resilience
- recovery from truncated or partially written tails

### Finalized payload

Used after clean close or after recovery + finalization.

Each finalized record contains:

- `recordLength`
- `recordType`
- `payload`

Purpose:

- compact playback artifact
- archive portability across file and MySQL backends
- optional chunk region entries follow their own contracts described above and are not embedded inside `replay.bin`

## Failure Rules

The v1 format is intentionally strict.

### Hard failures

Replay load must fail immediately when any of the following occur:

- invalid or missing payload header
- invalid or incompatible `formatVersion`
- `minimumViewerVersion` newer than the running plugin version
- manifest checksum mismatch
- malformed record framing
- unknown event tag encountered during replay load
- invalid string-table reference
- invalid tick-index offsets

### Error reporting expectations

When failure occurs, the loader should:

- stop replay load immediately
- show a clear incompatibility or corruption message
- log enough metadata for diagnosis

At minimum, logged metadata should include:

- replay identifier if available
- `formatVersion`
- `recordedWithVersion`
- `minimumViewerVersion`
- unknown event tag value, if relevant

## Versioning Rules

The format uses three separate version-related concepts:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `formatVersion` | Binary structure/schema compatibility |
| `recordedWithVersion` | Plugin version used to create the replay |
| `minimumViewerVersion` | Lowest plugin version allowed to load/play the replay |

### v1 rule set

- `formatVersion` is a simple integer
- v1 uses `formatVersion = 1`
- `minimumViewerVersion` should only change when playback semantics truly require a newer plugin version
- additive plugin releases do not imply a new `formatVersion`

## Current v1 Defaults Summary

| Decision | v1 choice |
|----------|-----------|
| Archive container | ZIP-style `.br` archive |
| Archive entry compression | `STORE` |
| Replay payload entry | `replay.bin` |
| Manifest entry | `manifest.json` |
| Payload compression | LZ4 |
| Load model | full decompression to heap `byte[]` |
| Record integrity in finalized payload | whole-payload checksum via manifest |
| Tick index interval | 50 ticks |
| Tick index entry contents | explicit tick + 64-bit offset |
| Unknown event tag handling | hard failure |
| `formatVersion` type | integer |
| Initial `formatVersion` | `1` |

## Reader Notes

Readers trying to understand the structure should think about the replay in this order:

1. open the `.br` archive
2. read and validate `manifest.json`
3. read `replay.bin`
4. LZ4-decompress the full payload into memory
5. validate payload header
6. load the tick index and string table support data
7. decode events lazily as needed for playback or export

## Future Evolution

The v1 format intentionally leaves room for future additions without complicating the first implementation.

Reserved future areas include:

- `chunks/` archive entries
- `meta/` archive entries
- richer manifest fields
- additional event tags
- more advanced offline tooling

Those future additions should still preserve the v1 principle that unsupported or ambiguous data fails clearly rather than being partially interpreted.
