# BetterReplay Archive Manifest Schema

This document defines the v1 schema for `manifest.json` inside a `.br` archive.

The goal of the manifest is to provide the metadata needed to:

- identify the archive as a BetterReplay replay
- validate compatibility before playback starts
- validate the integrity of `replay.bin`
- support diagnostics when replay loading fails

For the overall binary replay structure, see [BINARY_FORMAT_SPEC.md](BINARY_FORMAT_SPEC.md).

## Manifest Location

In v1, the manifest is stored as:

- `manifest.json`

at the root of the `.br` archive.

## Required v1 Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Purpose |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| `formatVersion` | integer | Yes | Binary structure/schema compatibility version |
| `recordedWithVersion` | string | Yes | Plugin version that created the replay |
| `minimumViewerVersion` | string | Yes | Minimum plugin version allowed to load/play the replay |
| `payloadChecksum` | string | Yes | Whole-payload checksum for `replay.bin` |
| `payloadChecksumAlgorithm` | string | Yes | Name of the checksum algorithm used for `payloadChecksum` |

## Field Definitions

### `formatVersion`

Type:

- integer

Meaning:

- the structural version of the binary replay format
- used by readers to decide whether they know how to parse the replay artifact

v1 rule:

- the first released binary archive format uses `1`

Example:

```json
"formatVersion": 1
```

### `recordedWithVersion`

Type:

- string

Meaning:

- the BetterReplay plugin version that wrote the replay
- used for diagnostics and support, not as the primary parser gate

Example:

```json
"recordedWithVersion": "1.5.0-SNAPSHOT"
```

### `minimumViewerVersion`

Type:

- string

Meaning:

- the minimum BetterReplay plugin version that may load and play the replay
- used as the user-facing compatibility gate before playback starts

Rules:

- if the running plugin version is older than this value, replay loading must fail before playback begins
- this value should change only when replay playback semantics actually require a newer plugin version

Example:

```json
"minimumViewerVersion": "1.5.0"
```

### `payloadChecksum`

Type:

- string

Meaning:

- checksum of the finalized `replay.bin` payload
- used to detect corruption or malformed archive contents

Representation:

- lowercase hexadecimal string is required for v1
- CRC32C values are stored as 8 lowercase hexadecimal digits

Example:

```json
"payloadChecksum": "7d8f8f2b"
```

### `payloadChecksumAlgorithm`

Type:

- string

Meaning:

- identifies how `payloadChecksum` was generated

Rules:

- readers must reject values they do not support
- the algorithm name should be stable and explicit rather than implied
- v1 uses the exact literal `CRC32C`

Example:

```json
"payloadChecksumAlgorithm": "CRC32C"
```

### v1 checksum representation rules

- `payloadChecksum` must be stored as lowercase hexadecimal
- `payloadChecksumAlgorithm` must be `CRC32C`
- the checksum is calculated over the exact stored bytes of `replay.bin`

## Example v1 Manifest

```json
{
  "formatVersion": 1,
  "recordedWithVersion": "1.5.0-SNAPSHOT",
  "minimumViewerVersion": "1.5.0",
  "payloadChecksum": "7d8f8f2b",
  "payloadChecksumAlgorithm": "CRC32C"
}
```

## Validation Order

Readers should validate manifest data before attempting full replay decode.

Recommended order:

1. confirm that `manifest.json` exists
2. parse the JSON successfully
3. confirm all required fields exist
4. validate field types
5. validate `formatVersion`
6. compare `minimumViewerVersion` to the running plugin version
7. read `replay.bin`
8. validate `payloadChecksum` using `payloadChecksumAlgorithm`

If any step fails, the replay must not proceed to playback.

## Failure Expectations

### Missing manifest

Result:

- hard failure

Reason:

- the archive cannot be trusted or version-gated without metadata

### Missing required field

Result:

- hard failure

Reason:

- replay compatibility or integrity cannot be safely determined

### Unsupported `formatVersion`

Result:

- hard failure

Reason:

- the reader does not know how to parse the binary structure safely

### Viewer version too old

Result:

- hard failure with a clear user-facing incompatibility message

Reason:

- replay semantics are not guaranteed to be valid on the older plugin version

### Unsupported checksum algorithm

Result:

- hard failure

Reason:

- the payload integrity cannot be validated reliably

### Checksum mismatch

Result:

- hard failure

Reason:

- `replay.bin` is corrupted, malformed, or not the expected payload

## Logging Expectations

When manifest validation fails, logs should include enough context for diagnosis.

Recommended logged values:

- archive name or replay identifier if known
- `formatVersion`
- `recordedWithVersion`
- `minimumViewerVersion`
- `payloadChecksumAlgorithm`
- the reason validation failed

## Reserved Future Fields

The v1 manifest is intentionally small.

Possible future additions include:

- replay duration
- tick count
- player count summary
- recording timestamp metadata
- chunk payload presence flags
- debug/export hints

Those fields are not required for v1 and should not be assumed by readers unless formally added in a later schema revision.

## v1 Summary

The v1 manifest exists to answer three questions before playback begins:

1. can this plugin parse the replay format?
2. is this plugin new enough to play the replay safely?
3. is the payload intact?

If the answer to any of those questions is no, replay load must stop immediately.
